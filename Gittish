Maybe make and alias for git
you will have to replace this = $ ie Branch_name File_name Clone_url
if you type in terminal man _ and it returns no manual entry it is free for me to use 
go into git mode
have an additional terminal tab open for only terminal commands
Q&A within termanial Shaunalynn will send more
run Gittish?
Gittish style modes
if gittish takes off then worry about social media, email etc
