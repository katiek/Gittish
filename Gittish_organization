Gittish Organization
Structure
Goals for Gittish - avoid memorization of commands and odd uses of letters and symbols that have meanings necessary in git...Gittish mode allows user to logically type in terminal git commands without prior knowledge of git's specific language...
at this level nothing for me to really break 
hidden profiles I think are .profiles
when using Gittish in learning mode maybe have fake collaborator to assist on the other side of pull requests etc
remind myself to keep things basic may need to Alias Aliases
